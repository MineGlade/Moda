# =====================================================
#                      Description
# =====================================================
# This plugin is a fully Modular core for your 
# bukkit/spigot server. Most modules are designed to 
# intricately work well together to provide the user 
# with an amazing experience.

# turn on or off modules quickly in the modules.yaml

# we've decided to make Moda open-source and free for
# everyone.

# If you're a developer and would like to develop your
# own module, please refer to the wiki:
# https://github.com/ModaPlugin/Moda/wiki/Module-development

# We appreciate everyone using the plugin, and we hope
# you'll be able to learn something from it.
