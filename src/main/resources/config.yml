# Plugin Configuration for iCore (by MineGlade)
# =====================================================
#                      Description
# =====================================================
# This plugin is a general all-purposes plugin designed
# specifically for MineGlade (https://minegla.de/).
# In stead of keeping the plugin custom and private,
# we've decided to make it open-source and free-to-use
# for other servers.
#
# We appreciate everyone using the plugin, and we hope
# you'll be able to learn something from it.
